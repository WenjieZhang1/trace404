# Flask project for monitoring CoronaVirus in USA.

# Install python required packages with 
## pip install -r requirements.txt


How to deploy to GCP?
1. Follow the tutorial in AppEngine.
2. Command for deployment: gcloud app deploy app.yaml --project ordinal-avatar-270006
3. There must be a main.py to start the Flask App.

I am also using GCP to auto manage the https ssl for my domain 404trace.com.
